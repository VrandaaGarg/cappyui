Create a modern AI Resume Builder component with the following specifications:

COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Build a React component called "ResumeBuilder" that demonstrates an AI-powered resume processing flow
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement with "use client" directive for Next.js client-side rendering

FEATURES:
1. File Upload Interface:
   - Clean upload card with drag-and-drop visual design
   - File input accepting: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf
   - Display upload icon (UploadCloud from lucide-react)
   - "Select file" button to trigger file picker
   - Descriptive text: "Upload resume" title and "Choose a PDF or DOCX to preview the AI resume building journey" subtitle

2. Processing Animation:
   - Show file details card with FileText icon and filename
   - Display 4 sequential processing steps with animated states:
     * "Parsing data from resume"
     * "Collecting and analysing experience"
     * "Extracting skills and keywords"
     * "Preparing tailored resume output"
   - Each step should have 3 states: pending (small dot), active (spinning loader), complete (green checkmark)
   - Steps animate sequentially with 1100ms delay between each
   - Show Loader2 spinner in file card header during processing

3. Success Toast:
   - After processing completes, show success toast notification at top
   - Toast content: CheckCircle2 icon + "Resume processed successfully"
   - Toast auto-dismisses after 2200ms
   - Toast has dark background with light text (inverted in dark mode)

4. Local Storage Persistence:
   - Store uploaded file metadata (name, size, type, uploadedAt) in localStorage
   - Key: "resume-builder-demo"
   - Restore stored resume data on component mount
   - Only store metadata, not actual file content

5. State Management:
   - viewState: "idle" | "processing"
   - stepStatuses: array of "pending" | "active" | "complete"
   - currentFile: stores current processing file metadata
   - storedResume: persisted resume from localStorage
   - justCompleted: triggers success toast display

STYLING:
- Use Tailwind CSS with neutral color palette
- Dark mode support throughout
- Main container: max-w-xl, rounded-lg, border, gradient background blur effect
- Decorative gradient blob at top: purple/violet gradient with blur-3xl
- Upload card: border-dashed, rounded-xl, centered content
- Processing card: solid border, rounded-lg, white/dark background
- Step items: rounded-lg cards with borders, icon on left, status indicator on right
- Use motion from framer-motion for all animations
- AnimatePresence for smooth enter/exit transitions
- File card: neutral background, border, displays filename and "Processing resume" label

ANIMATIONS:
- Upload card: fade in with y: 20 slide
- Processing card: fade in with y: 20 slide
- Success toast: fade + slide from top (y: -12)
- Step items: staggered fade in (delay: index * 0.05)
- All transitions use duration: 0.3-0.4s with easeOut
- Button whileTap scale: 0.97

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use useRef for file input and timers management
- Clean up all timers on unmount
- Format file size helper: converts bytes to KB/MB/GB
- Prevent file picker opening during processing
- Reset file input value after selection
- Type-safe interfaces for all props and state

COMPONENT STRUCTURE:
- Single wrapper div with gradient background and decorative blob
- Hidden file input element
- AnimatePresence with mode="wait" for view transitions
- Idle view: upload prompt card
- Processing view: file card + steps list
- Success toast: absolute positioned, conditionally rendered

DEPENDENCIES:
- react (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, useRef)
- framer-motion (motion, AnimatePresence)
- lucide-react (CheckCircle2, FileText, Loader2, UploadCloud)
- @/lib/utils (cn utility function)

Make sure the component is fully self-contained, production-ready, and follows React best practices with proper cleanup and memoization.
