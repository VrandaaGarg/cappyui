Create a React component called "Tool Grid" with the following specifications:

## Component Requirements:

1. **Layout**:
   - Create a 4x4 grid (16 cells total)
   - Each cell should be a rounded square (14x14, w-14 h-14)
   - Inside each bordered square, add another rounded square (inner square: 11x11, w-11 h-11)
   - Leave 5 cells empty (no icons)
   - Place tool/service icons in 11 cells
   - Grid container: rounded-xl with padding, neutral background with border and outline

2. **Icons**:
   - Use react-icons library
   - Include icons for various tools/services: Claude (SiClaude), VS Code (VscVscodeInsiders), Gemini (RiGeminiFill), Meta (SiMeta), OpenAI (SiOpenai), GitHub (FaGithubAlt), Clerk (SiClerk), Notion (SiNotion), Firebase (RiFirebaseFill), Appwrite (SiAppwrite), React (RiReactjsFill)
   - Create an array with icon positions using row/col coordinates and hex color codes
   - Example: `{ row: 3, col: 3, icon: <SiClaude />, name: "Claude", bgColor: "#D97757" }`

3. **Animation**:
   - Icons start in grayscale/neutral colors
   - Custom sequence animation (not linear): Define ANIMATION_SEQUENCE array
   - When an icon becomes active, it displays its unique hex color
   - Previous active icon returns to grayscale
   - Continuous loop through all icons following custom sequence
   - Animation interval: 2000ms (2 seconds) per icon
   - Active icon scales to 1.1 (10% larger)
   - Active icon has neutral shadow (shadow-lg shadow-neutral-400/50 dark:shadow-neutral-900/80)
   - NO rotation or colored glow effects

4. **Styling**:
   - Outer cell: 56px (w-14 h-14), rounded-lg
   - Inner square: 44px (w-11 h-11), rounded-lg
   - Empty cells:
     * Gradient backgrounds with varied neutral shades
     * Different shades for each empty cell based on position
     * Example: "bg-neutral-50/80 dark:bg-neutral-900"
   - Filled cells with icons:
     * Outer: border with white/neutral-800 background
     * Inner active: solid hex color background with white text
     * Inner inactive: gradient neutral background with muted text
   - Grid container: bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-900/40 with border-2 and outline
   - Smooth transitions: 1.2s duration with easeInOut

5. **Dark Mode**:
   - Full support for light and dark themes
   - Empty cells have different backgrounds for light/dark
   - Borders adjust: neutral-200 (light) / neutral-700-800 (dark)
   - Container background: neutral-100 (light) / neutral-900/40 (dark)
   - Use Tailwind's dark: prefix throughout

6. **Empty Cell Variations**:
   - Create getEmptyBgColor function that returns different shades based on position
   - Use (rowIndex + colIndex) % shades.length for variation
   - 4 different shade combinations for empty cells

7. **Technical Details**:
   - Use framer-motion for all animations
   - Use useState for tracking activeSequenceIndex
   - Use useEffect with setInterval for animation loop
   - Clean up interval on component unmount
   - TypeScript support with proper interfaces (ToolGridProps, GridIcon)
   - Initial staggered entrance animation with delay based on position
   - Hex colors only (no Tailwind gradient classes for icon colors)

8. **Props**:
   - className?: string (optional additional CSS classes)

## Dependencies:
- framer-motion
- react-icons (si, ri, fa, vsc)
- tailwind-merge and clsx for className utilities

## Animation Flow:
1. Component mounts with staggered entrance animation (delay: position * 0.05s)
2. After mount, start custom sequence animation
3. Each icon lights up with its hex color for 2 seconds
4. Active icon scales to 1.1 and shows neutral shadow
5. Previous icon fades back to grayscale (opacity 0.6)
6. Loop continues infinitely following ANIMATION_SEQUENCE
7. Smooth transitions with 1.2s duration and easeInOut easing

## Key Features:
- Custom non-linear animation sequence
- Hex color backgrounds for active icons
- Varied neutral shades for empty cells
- Scale and neutral shadow on active icons
- No colored glow or rotation effects
- Clean, professional appearance
- Excellent dark mode support

The component should be visually clean, professional, and showcase various tool/service icons in a smooth animated grid format.
