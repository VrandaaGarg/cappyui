Create a React component called WaveEffectCard with the following specifications:

## Visual Design
- A grid of button-style cards arranged in rows with varying widths (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Cards have rounded borders with neutral-200/80 border in light mode, neutral-700/80 in dark mode
- Cards have bg-neutral-200/50 in light mode, bg-neutral-900/80 in dark mode
- Cards display security-themed text labels (Encrypt, Shield, Guard, Secure, Protect, etc.)
- Initial state: all cards have low opacity (default 0.2)
- Container has radial gradient mask for smooth edge fading

## Center Content Overlay
- Centered icon button with gradient background (white to neutral-200 light, neutral-800 to neutral-900 dark)
- Icon button has border styling and shadow-xl with blue tint
- Title text (default: "We're serious about privacy.")
- Subtitle and description text below title
- Default icon: HiMiniLockClosed from react-icons/hi2

## Animation Phases
The component cycles through 4 phases:
1. **charging**: Icon button scales up (1 -> 1.1 -> 1.08) with blue glow building
2. **pulse**: Icon button scales down then back (1.08 -> 0.92 -> 1), ripple div emanates
3. **wave**: Circular wave ripple propagates through cards, affecting their opacity
4. **idle**: Brief rest before cycling back to charging

## Wave Animation Effect
- A circular wave ripple emanates from the center of the container
- The wave is a ring with inner and outer radius (creating thickness)
- Both radii increase over time, but the ring thickness remains constant
- The ring edges have a smooth easing effect (easeInOutSine)
- Cards within the wave ring have active opacity (default 0.75)
- Cards outside the ring have base opacity (default 0.2)
- AnimatePresence ripple visual with radial gradient blue glow

## Technical Requirements
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
- Proper cleanup on unmount to prevent memory leaks
- ResizeObserver for responsive container sizing
- Memoized components for performance (React.memo)
- TypeScript with proper types
- framer-motion for icon and ripple animations
- "use client" directive for Next.js compatibility

## Props
- items: string[] - Array of card labels (default: 80 security-themed words)
- waveSpeed: number - Animation speed in pixels per second (default: 100)
- waveThickness: number - Ring thickness in pixels (default: 80)
- fadeWidth: number - Soft edge fade width (default: 50)
- baseOpacity: number - Opacity outside wave (default: 0.2)
- activeOpacity: number - Opacity inside wave (default: 0.75)
- className: string - Additional CSS classes
- title: string - Main title text (default: "We're serious about privacy.")
- subtitle: string - Subtitle text (default: "Your data is built with privacy at its core.")
- description: string - Description text (default: "We never train on your data.")
- icon: React.ReactNode - Custom icon element
- glowDuration: number - Duration of charging glow animation (default: 0.6)

## Opacity Calculation Logic
For each card, calculate its center distance from the container center:
1. If distance < innerRadius - fadeWidth: baseOpacity
2. If distance in fade-in zone [innerRadius - fadeWidth, innerRadius]: eased gradient from base to active
3. If distance in ring [innerRadius, outerRadius]: activeOpacity
4. If distance in fade-out zone [outerRadius, outerRadius + fadeWidth]: eased gradient from active to base
5. If distance > outerRadius + fadeWidth: baseOpacity
Uses easeInOutSine for smooth transitions: -(Math.cos(Math.PI * t) - 1) / 2

## Card Layout
- Container: max-w-xl, h-96, rounded-2xl, overflow-hidden
- Card grid positioned absolute with -top-8, -left-8 and calc(100%+4rem) width
- Use flex-wrap with gap-2 for organic masonry-like appearance
- Pre-defined width pattern cycling through 50 entries for varied look
- Width classes: sm (w-14/w-16), md (w-18/w-20), lg (w-22/w-24), xl (w-26/w-28)
- Height: h-7 sm:h-8 for all cards
- Font: text-xs font-mono font-medium

## Default Security Words Array
["Encrypt", "Shield", "Guard", "Secure", "Protect", "Private", "Safety", "Locked", "Cipher", "Verify",
"Trust", "Defense", "Firewall", "Auth", "Token", "Hash", "SSL", "VPN", "2FA", "Biometric",
"Access", "Vault", "Key", "Secret", "Stealth", "Armor", "Sentinel", "Fortress", "Barrier", "Filter",
"Sandbox", "Proxy", "Audit", "Comply", "GDPR", "Zero-Trust", "E2E", "AES", "RSA", "HTTPS"]

## Animation Loop
- Track elapsed time using requestAnimationFrame timestamp
- Calculate current radius from elapsed time and speed
- Reset radius and transition to charging phase when wave exceeds container diagonal + wave thickness + fade width
- Update all card opacities each frame during wave phase

## Dependencies
- framer-motion (motion, AnimatePresence)
- react-icons/hi2 (HiMiniLockClosed)
- lucide-react (LockIcon - imported but using HiMiniLockClosed as default)
- cn utility function from @/lib/utils

Use modern React patterns (hooks, memo, useCallback, useMemo) and ensure the component is a "use client" component for Next.js compatibility.
