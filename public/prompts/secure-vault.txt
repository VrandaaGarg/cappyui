Create an animated secure vault React component with the following specifications:

## Component Requirements

Create a SecureVault component that visualizes a secure vault opening sequence with these features:

### Visual Structure
- A rounded container with a border and outline (rounded-32px)
- Background that adapts to light/dark theme (white/neutral-950)
- Centered security icon (96x96px) with a circular border that glows cyan when vault opens
- Top and bottom animated vault doors that split apart when opening

### SVG Security Icon (443x512 viewBox)
The security icon should include these layered elements:
1. **Shield path**: Main shield shape centered at (221, 225)
2. **Lock body**: Rectangular lock body in the center
3. **Lock shackle**: Curved shackle that rotates -28deg and moves up 12px when opening
4. **Lock keyhole**: Keyhole that lights up (cyan-400/300) when circuits complete
5. **Outer security circuits**: 4 decorative circuit/connection patterns around the main shield

### Animation Sequence (Continuous Loop)
1. **Circuit Activation Phase** (960ms total):
   - Use an expanding circular mask centered on the security icon
   - Animate the mask radius from 0 to 360 in 8 steps (CIRCUIT_STEP_COUNT = 8)
   - Each step takes 120ms with 200ms pause after completion
   - Reveals the cyan-colored security elements progressively from center outward
   - Gray elements remain visible underneath at reduced opacity

2. **Lock Opening Phase** (400ms):
   - Rotate the lock shackle -28 degrees
   - Translate it upward by -12px
   - Transform origin should be at the bottom of the shackle (221.5px, 210px)

3. **Vault Opening Phase** (600ms):
   - Top door: SVG path moves up 60px (from -15px to -60px)
   - Bottom door: Mirrored SVG path moves down 60px (from 15px to 60px)
   - Both doors fade to 85% opacity
   - The door paths should have curved corners using quadratic bezier curves

4. **Glow Effect**:
   - When vault opens, the circular border changes to cyan (#22d3ee)
   - Add cyan box-shadow with multiple layers for glow effect
   - Inner border also changes to cyan
   - Trigger a shine effect (light sweep across the icon from left to right)

5. **Hold State** (1500ms): Keep vault open before restarting loop

### Door Path Geometry
Create door paths with these characteristics:
- Use SVG path commands (M, L, Q for curves, Z for close)
- Top door should have curved notches that mirror on bottom door
- ViewBox: 850x450
- Door paths should extend beyond viewbox edges for seamless appearance
- Use linear gradients for door fill (lighter in middle, darker at edges)

### Color Scheme
**Light mode:**
- Background: white
- Inactive elements: neutral-300 to neutral-400
- Active elements: cyan-500
- Doors: neutral-200/neutral-300 gradient

**Dark mode:**
- Background: neutral-950
- Inactive elements: neutral-700 to neutral-800
- Active elements: cyan-400
- Doors: neutral-800/neutral-900 gradient

### Technical Implementation
- Use framer-motion for all animations
- Use useState for: circuitStep, lockOpen, vaultOpen, isDark
- Use useAnimationControls for the shine effect
- Use useId for unique mask ID (remove colons for SVG compatibility)
- Implement continuous loop with async/await sequence
- Add proper cleanup with cancelRef and timeout tracking
- Use MutationObserver to detect theme changes
- Memoize the component with React.memo

### Props
- className?: string (for additional styling)

### Responsive Design
- Container: h-[300px] w-full max-w-xs
- Padding adjusts on mobile (left-4/right-4) vs desktop (left-8/right-8)
- Icon scales proportionally within container

The component should feel like a high-tech security system activation sequence with smooth, coordinated animations that loop continuously. Use easeInOut easing for all transitions to create a polished feel.
