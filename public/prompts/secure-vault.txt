Create an animated secure vault React component with the following specifications:

## Component Requirements

Create a SecureVault component that visualizes a secure vault opening sequence with these features:

### Visual Structure
- A rounded container with a border and outline (rounded-32px)
- Background that adapts to light/dark theme (white/neutral-950)
- Centered circular vault door mechanism (96x96px) with border that glows white/gray when vault opens
- Top and bottom animated vault doors that split apart when opening
- Rotating vault door icon inside a circular container with concentric circles

### Vault Door Mechanism (74x74px circular container)
The vault door should include these elements:
1. **Concentric Circles Background** (12 circles):
   - Alternating radial gradients for 3D metallic effect
   - Even circles: Light source at 35% 35% (grooves)
   - Odd circles: Light source at 65% 65% (ridges)
   - Border opacity varies: neutral-400/30 to neutral-500/20 (light), neutral-900/20 to neutral-800/20 (dark)
   - Creates realistic vault lock appearance with depth

2. **Main Container Radial Gradient**:
   - Dark theme: radial-gradient(circle at 30% 30%, #525252 0%, #404040 30%, #262626 60%, #171717 100%)
   - Light theme: radial-gradient(circle at 30% 30%, #d4d4d4 0%, #a3a3a3 30%, #737373 60%, #525252 100%)
   - Light source from top-left creates metallic depth

3. **Rotating Vault Door SVG** (viewBox: 250 -25 200 500):
   - Custom path with curved design
   - Rotates 90 degrees when vault opens
   - Size: 10x10 (w-10 h-10)
   - Theme-aware colors: white (dark) / black (light)
   - Stroke width: 3px with round caps and joins

### Animation Sequence (Continuous Loop)
1. **Icon Fade-In Phase** (960ms total):
   - Animate vault door icon opacity from 0.3 to 1.0 in 8 steps (CIRCUIT_STEP_COUNT = 8)
   - Each step takes 120ms with 300ms pause after completion
   - Progressive opacity: 0.5 + (circuitStep / CIRCUIT_STEP_COUNT) * 0.5

2. **Vault Opening Phase** (800ms):
   - Vault door icon rotates 90 degrees clockwise
   - Top door: SVG path moves up 60px (from -15px to -60px)
   - Bottom door: Mirrored SVG path moves down 60px (from 15px to 60px)
   - Both doors fade to 85% opacity
   - The door paths should have curved corners using quadratic bezier curves

3. **Glow Effect**:
   - When vault opens, the circular border changes color:
     - Dark theme: white (#FFFFFF)
     - Light theme: gray (#696969)
   - Add white/black box-shadow with multiple layers for glow effect
   - Inner border also changes to white/black
   - Trigger a shine effect (light sweep across the icon from left to right)
     - Dark theme: white shine
     - Light theme: neutral-200 shine

4. **Hold State** (1500ms): Keep vault open before restarting loop

### Door Path Geometry
Create door paths with these characteristics:
- Use SVG path commands (M, L, Q for curves, Z for close)
- Top door should have curved notches that mirror on bottom door
- ViewBox: 850x450
- Door paths should extend beyond viewbox edges for seamless appearance
- Use linear gradients for door fill (lighter in middle, darker at edges)

### Color Scheme
**Light mode:**
- Background: white
- Vault door icon: black
- Border when open: gray (#696969)
- Shine effect: neutral-200
- Doors: e5e5e5/f5f5f5/e5e5e5 gradient
- Door lines: neutral-300
- Concentric circles: neutral-400/30 to neutral-500/20 borders
- Radial gradients: lighter neutrals (d4d4d4 to 525252)

**Dark mode:**
- Background: neutral-950
- Vault door icon: white
- Border when open: white (#FFFFFF)
- Shine effect: white
- Doors: 171717/262626/171717 gradient
- Door lines: neutral-700
- Concentric circles: neutral-900/20 to neutral-800/20 borders
- Radial gradients: darker neutrals (525252 to 171717)

### Technical Implementation
- Use framer-motion for all animations
- Use useState for: circuitStep, vaultOpen, isDark (removed lockOpen)
- Use useAnimationControls for the shine effect
- Use useRef for: cancelRef, timeoutsRef, isMountedRef (memory leak prevention)
- Implement continuous loop with async/await sequence
- Add proper cleanup with cancelRef and timeout tracking
- Use MutationObserver to detect theme changes
- Memoize the component with React.memo
- Stop animations on unmount with shineControls.stop()
- Check isMountedRef.current before all state updates

### Props
- className?: string (for additional styling)

### Responsive Design
- Container: h-[300px] w-full max-w-xs
- Padding adjusts on mobile (left-4/right-4) vs desktop (left-8/right-8)
- Icon scales proportionally within container

The component should feel like a high-tech security system activation sequence with smooth, coordinated animations that loop continuously. Use easeInOut easing for all transitions to create a polished feel.
