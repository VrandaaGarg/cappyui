Spam Notifications Component - LLM Prompt
Create a React component called SpamNotifications that displays an animated stack of spam-like notification messages with glassmorphism effects.

Dependencies to Install
npm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
Requirements

1. Component Structure
   Create a "use client" component named SpamNotifications
   Accept a className prop for custom styling
   Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
2. Notification Data Structure
   Create 8 spam notification messages with this interface:

interface NotificationMessage {
id: string;
icon: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>;
title: string;
subtitle: string;
time: string;
color: string;
}
The 8 notifications should be:

Amazon - "Congratulations! You've won a $1,000 gift card.Offer ends in 2 days. So hurry up and claim it before it's too late!" - Time: "6 min ago" - Color: bg-orange-500/90 - Icon: Gift
Security Alert - "Unusual activity detected. Verify your identity now to avoid account suspension. Offer ends in 2 days. So hurry up and claim it before it's too late!" - Time: "10 min ago" - Color: bg-red-500/90 - Icon: Mail
Dating App - "You have 23 new matches.nearby Offer ends in 2 days. So hurry up and claim it before it's too late!" - Time: "15 min ago" - Color: bg-pink-500/90 - Icon: Bell
Flash Sale - "90% off everything - ends in 5 minutes. you should claimed it before it's too late!" - Time: "24 min ago" - Color: bg-yellow-500/90 - Icon: Zap
McAfee Security - "3 viruses detected on your device.Go and remove them before it's too late!" - Time: "2:48 PM" - Color: bg-blue-500/90 - Icon: Shield
Apple Store - "You're our millionth visitor! Claim your iPhone. It is the best deal!" - Time: "3:12 PM" - Color: bg-purple-500/90 - Icon: Trophy
Investment Opportunity - "Make $5,000/day working from home.Just click the link and start earning now!" - Time: "3:15 PM" - Color: bg-green-500/90 - Icon: Rocket
Exclusive Reward - "Spin the wheel to unlock hidden bonuses.You can win a lifetime supply of apple products." - Time: "3:17 PM" - Color: bg-amber-500/90 - Icon: Star
Use icons from lucide-react: Bell, Mail, Star, Gift, Zap, Trophy, Shield, Rocket

3. Animation Configuration
   Define these constants:

MAX_NOTIFICATIONS = 8
STAGGER_DELAY = 450 (ms between each notification appearing)
DISPLAY_DURATION = 4500 (ms to display all notifications)
FADE_DURATION = 1200 (ms for fade out) 4. State Management
Use these state variables:

visibleNotifications - array of currently visible notifications
animationPhase - one of: "stacking" | "displaying" | "fading"
animationCycle - number to track animation cycles
isMounted - boolean for hydration safety
isActiveRef - useRef to track component mount state
timeoutIdsRef - useRef to store and cleanup timeouts 5. Animation Logic
Implement a startAnimation function that:

Clears all previous timeouts
Resets visible notifications
Increments animation cycle
Adds notifications one by one with STAGGER_DELAY between each
After stacking phase, waits DISPLAY_DURATION before fading
After fading, clears notifications and restarts the cycle
Uses isActiveRef.current checks to prevent updates after unmount 6. Notification Positions
Define 8 predefined positions with x, y offsets and rotation:

[
{ x: 0, y: 0, rotate: 0 },
{ x: 30, y: -40, rotate: 5 },
{ x: -35, y: 35, rotate: -6 },
{ x: 85, y: -20, rotate: 3 },
{ x: -70, y: 55, rotate: -4 },
{ x: 100, y: -60, rotate: 4 },
{ x: -45, y: 20, rotate: -3 },
{ x: 65, y: -75, rotate: 6 },
] 7. Glassmorphism Card Design
Each notification card should have:

Rounded corners: rounded-2xl
Border: border-white/30 (light) / border-white/20 (dark)
Backdrop blur: backdrop-blur-2xl
Semi-transparent background: bg-white/80 (light) / bg-neutral-900/80 (dark)
Shadow: shadow-2xl shadow-neutral-200 (light mode)
Gradient overlay: from-white/50 to-transparent (light) / from-white/5 to-transparent (dark) 8. Card Layout
Each card contains:

Top row: Icon (small colored square), Title, Time (right-aligned)
Bottom row: Subtitle (2 lines max with line-clamp-2)
Icon size: w-5 h-5 with icon inside at w-3 h-3
Padding: p-4 9. Framer Motion Configuration
Use motion.div with:

Initial state: opacity: 0, scale: 0.5, centered with x: "-50%", y: "-50%", rotate: 0
Animate state: Opacity and scale based on animation phase, position based on index
Exit state: opacity: 0, scale: 0.5, duration 0.4s
Transition: duration: 0.8, custom ease curve [0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1]
Style: zIndex based on index, willChange: "transform, opacity"
Key: Unique key combining animationCycle, notification.id, and index 10. Container
Main container: min-h-[400px] centered with flex
Inner container: h-[400px] with max-w-4xl
Each notification: w-80 positioned absolutely
Use AnimatePresence from framer-motion 11. Hydration Safety
Only render notifications when isMounted is true
Set isMounted to true in useEffect after mount
Start animation only after mounting 12. Cleanup
Implement proper cleanup in useEffect return function
Set isActiveRef.current = false on unmount
Clear all timeouts on unmount 13. Utility Function
Create or use a cn() utility function to merge Tailwind classes:

import { ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
Key Implementation Details
Use useCallback for startAnimation, scheduleTimeout, and clearAllTimeouts
Use useMemo for positions array and fallback position
Use useRef to track active state and timeout IDs
Ensure all timeout callbacks check isActiveRef.current before executing
Calculate positions dynamically based on notification index
Support both light and dark mode with appropriate color schemes
Expected Behavior
Component mounts and waits for client-side hydration
Notifications pop in one by one from the center to their positions
Each notification has a bouncy pop-in animation
After all notifications appear, they stay visible for a few seconds
All notifications fade out together
The cycle repeats infinitely
Notifications have glassmorphism effect with blur and transparency
Component properly cleans up on unmount
