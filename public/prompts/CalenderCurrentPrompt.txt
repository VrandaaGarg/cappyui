React Calendar Component Prompt
Create a modern, animated calendar component in React with the following specifications:
Component Overview
Build a CalendarCurrent component that displays a monthly calendar view with smooth animations, navigation controls, and today's date highlighted. The calendar should show a 6-week grid (42 days) including overflow days from previous and next months.
Required Dependencies
Install the following packages:
bashnpm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge
Utility Function
First, create a utility file at @/lib/utils.ts:
typescriptimport { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
Component Requirements
1. Core Functionality

Display current month and year with ability to navigate between months
Show all days in a 7x6 grid (42 cells total)
Include overflow days from previous and next months (displayed with reduced opacity)
Highlight today's date with primary color and a check icon
Responsive navigation with previous/next month buttons

2. Visual Design

Clean card layout with rounded corners and shadow
Header with month/year display centered between navigation arrows
Day-of-week labels (Su, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa)
Grid layout with proper spacing
Use CSS custom properties for theming:

--fd-background - card background
--fd-foreground - primary text
--fd-muted-foreground - secondary text
--fd-border - border color
--fd-accent - hover state
--fd-primary - today highlight
--fd-primary-foreground - today text color



3. Animations (using Framer Motion)

Navigation buttons: scale on hover (1.1x) and tap (0.95x)
Month/year text: fade and slide animation when changing months
Calendar grid: fade transition between months
Individual day cells: staggered entrance animation (each cell delayed by 0.01s)
Today indicator: check icon appears with scale and fade animation

4. Component Structure
CalendarCurrent
├── Header
│   ├── Previous Month Button (ChevronLeft icon)
│   ├── Month Year Display
│   └── Next Month Button (ChevronRight icon)
├── Day Headers Row (Su-Sa)
└── Calendar Grid (7 columns × 6 rows)
    └── Day Cells (with conditional styling)
5. State Management

currentMonth: number (0-11)
currentYear: number
Track today's date for highlighting
Calculate days to display including overflow from adjacent months

6. Helper Functions to Implement

getDaysInMonth(month, year) - returns number of days in month
getFirstDayOfMonth(month, year) - returns day of week (0-6) for first day
isToday(day, month, year) - checks if date matches today
handlePrevMonth() - navigates to previous month (handles year boundary)
handleNextMonth() - navigates to next month (handles year boundary)

7. Styling Classes

Card: max-width 28rem, rounded-3xl, padding 2rem, shadow-lg
Navigation buttons: 40px × 40px, rounded-lg, hover effects
Month/year text: text-xl, bold, letter-spacing wide
Day cells: 48px height, rounded-lg, text-lg
Today cell: primary background, white text, shadow-md
Non-current month days: 40% opacity

8. Accessibility

Add aria-label attributes to navigation buttons
Proper semantic HTML structure
Keyboard navigation support through native button elements

9. Props Interface
typescriptinterface CalendarCurrentProps {
  className?: string; // Optional additional styling
}
10. Constants
typescriptconst DAYS = ["Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa"];
const MONTHS = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", 
                "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
Implementation Notes

Use TypeScript for type safety
Component should be a client component ("use client" directive)
Default export the component
Grid always shows 42 cells (6 rows × 7 days) for consistent height
Stagger animation creates a smooth reveal effect for all day cells
Today's date shows a check icon overlay on top of the date number

Tailwind Configuration
Ensure your tailwind.config.js includes custom CSS variables or define them in your global CSS:
css:root {
  --fd-background: white;
  --fd-foreground: #1a1a1a;
  --fd-muted-foreground: #6b7280;
  --fd-border: #e5e7eb;
  --fd-accent: #f3f4f6;
  --fd-primary: #3b82f6;
  --fd-primary-foreground: white;
}
