Leadership Spotlight Component
Create an animated team showcase component that displays a 2x2 grid of team member cards with an intelligent scanning border effect that highlights each member sequentially.
Dependencies Required
bashnpm install framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge
Component Architecture
Main Component: VisitTeam.tsx

Type: Client-side React component ("use client")
Props Interface:

className?: string - Optional styling override



Data Structure
typescriptinterface TeamMember {
  name: string;
  role: string;
  image: string; // URL to team member photo
}
Layout Structure
Container Hierarchy

Outer wrapper: Flex column, centered, with padding (px-6 md:px-8) and gap-7
Header section:

Title: "Leadership Spotlight" (text-4xl, font-bold)
Subtitle: Descriptive text (text-lg, mt-3, muted color)
Max width: max-w-3xl, centered


Grid container:

Max width: max-w-md
Relative positioning for absolute border overlay


Inner grid:

CSS Grid: 2 columns (grid-cols-2)
Gap: 1.5rem (gap-6)
Contains 4 cards + 1 animated border overlay



Card Structure

Dimensions: aspect-[3/4] ratio (portrait orientation)
Styling: rounded-2xl, overflow-hidden, bg-black
Contains:

Background image (absolute positioned, full cover)
Bio tag overlay (absolute positioned at bottom with inset-x-3 bottom-3)



Animation System
Timing Constants

SCAN_DURATION: 2 seconds per card
TOTAL_DURATION: 8 seconds (2s × 4 cards)
POSITION_SEQUENCE: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0] - defines which card index is active at each keyframe
KEYFRAME_TIMES: [0, 0.0625, 0.25, 0.3125, 0.5, 0.5625, 0.75, 0.8125, 1] - normalized time points (0-1) for each keyframe

Animation Logic
Image Animations (per card)
For each of 4 cards, create animation based on its index:

Filter (grayscale):

Map through POSITION_SEQUENCE
If position matches card index: grayscale(0%) (full color)
Otherwise: grayscale(100%) (grayscale)


Scale:

Active card: 1.05
Inactive cards: 1.0


Transition: duration = TOTAL_DURATION, times = KEYFRAME_TIMES, ease = "easeInOut", infinite loop

Bio Tag Animations (per card)

Opacity:

Active card: 1 (visible)
Inactive cards: 0 (hidden)


Y-translation:

Active card: 0 (normal position)
Inactive cards: 12 (slightly down)


Same transition config as images

Scanning Border Animation
Complex feature requiring DOM measurements:

Setup Phase (useEffect + useRef):

Create refs for: grid container, all 4 card elements
Measure each card's position relative to grid on mount and resize
Store: cardPositions[] array with {x, y} coordinates
Measure first card's: width, height, borderRadius


Border Position Calculation:

Map POSITION_SEQUENCE to actual pixel coordinates
Creates array of 9 position keyframes matching the sequence


Border Structure (motion.div overlay):

Absolute positioned at top-left initially
Width/height match measured card dimensions
Contains 4 corner bracket divs (not full borders)
Each corner: 3px border with 2 sides (L-shaped brackets)
Border color: blue-500


Corner Bracket Dimensions:

Calculate dynamically: min(cardWidth, cardHeight) * 0.15
Minimum: frameRadius + 8px
Maximum: shortestSide / 1.8
Ensures corners don't overlap


Border Animation:

Animate X: array of 9 x-coordinates
Animate Y: array of 9 y-coordinates
Duration: TOTAL_DURATION (8s)
Times: KEYFRAME_TIMES
Ease: "linear" (for border movement)
Infinite loop



Bio Tag Styling

Background: bg-black/75 with backdrop-blur
Padding: px-3 py-2
Border radius: rounded-xl
Shadow: shadow-[0_8px_24px_rgba(15,23,42,0.35)]
Text colors: white for name, white/70 for role
Font sizes:

Name: text-[12px] md:text-sm, font-semibold
Role: text-[8px] md:text-[12px], font-medium



Measurement System
Key Implementation Details

Initial measurement: Run on component mount via useEffect
Resize listener: Re-measure on window resize
Position calculation:

Get grid's bounding rect
Get each card's bounding rect
Calculate relative positions: cardRect.left - gridRect.left, cardRect.top - gridRect.top


State updates: Only update if positions actually changed (optimization)
Border radius extraction: Parse from computed styles of first card

Performance Optimizations

Use React.memo for component
Use useMemo for derived calculations
Use useCallback for measurement function
Set willChange: "transform, opacity" on animated elements
Prevent unnecessary re-renders with state comparison

Sample Data
Provide 4 team members with:

Professional names
Executive-level roles
High-quality portrait photos (3:4 aspect ratio preferred)
Use placeholder image URLs from free stock photo sites

Utility Function
Create cn() utility using clsx and tailwind-merge to merge className props with component classes.
Critical Implementation Notes

The border overlay must be positioned absolutely within the grid container
Border measurements must happen after images load (use onLoad callback)
The border's width, height, and borderRadius must dynamically match the measured card dimensions
The 4 corner brackets create the scanning frame effect (not a full border)
All animations must share the same KEYFRAME_TIMES array for synchronization
The POSITION_SEQUENCE determines which card is "active" at each keyframe step
